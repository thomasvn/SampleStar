# Assumptions

- The hardware device's processor/network latency is negligible
- The hardware device has perfect availability
- The hardware generates random floats valued between 0 and 1
- These random floats only have 16 decimal digits of accuracy
- The hardware device has an internet accessible API
- The hardware device can handle heavy loads (through concurrency & increased worker nodes)
