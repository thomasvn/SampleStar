# SampleStar Application Stub

NOTE.
This code is a temporary stub in place of the real application.
Our developers are hard at work building an application to query our innovative hardware device with near-zero latency.

This code is a Flask App that provides the same API specifications as the real application, but only serves pseudo-random numbers to the users.

```bash
# Local build
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Container build
```
